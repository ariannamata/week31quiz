        <h2>My favorite part of Advanced Web</h2>
        <p>My favorite part of Patino is the freedom and real world
   experience. There is no other school that will basically
   treat you like the near adults you are and I think that's
   really cool. There is also the fact that you run a business
   or you get to work with real clients. There is no other
   highschool that would do this. It's why it's so great.</p>
        <h2>My least favorite part of Advanced Web</h2>
        <p> My least favorite part of Patino is also my favorite.
        Being treated like an adult means having much more
        responsibility than most highschool students have. It
        means being more self reliant, accountable, and
        recognizing your own bad habits so that you can
        succeed. I think this can be very difficult because
        it requires a lot of independent and self reflection.</p>
